# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction and Risk Analysis

**Author:** Sai Babji Kommera  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, Power BI, Tableau  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes car insurance claim data to identify high-risk policyholders, understand claim patterns, and extract insights using Python-based visualization techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed information on driver demographics, vehicle features, behavioral indicators, and claim history.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand which demographics and behaviors increase claim likelihood
- Visualize key trends across vehicle types, credit scores, and accidents
- Provide actionable insights to help insurers and policyholders
- Detect patterns that may aid in fraud prevention or risk pricing

## 🛠️ Data and Preprocessing

- Data was cleaned and preprocessed using `pandas`
- Missing values handled with imputation/drop strategies
- Categorical features encoded as needed for analysis
- Key features included: `Annual Mileage`, `Credit Score`, `Vehicle Type`, `Speeding Violations`, `Past Accidents`, and `Outcome`

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identifies strength and direction of feature relationships
- **Scatter Plot:** Shows how credit score and annual mileage vary by vehicle type
- **Bar & Line Charts (Excel/Power BI):** Additional visual insights

## 📈 Key Insights

- Drivers with lower credit scores and high mileage are more likely to file claims
- Certain vehicle types are consistently associated with higher risk
- Speeding violations and past accidents strongly correlate with claims

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can:
- Help insurers optimize premium pricing
- Identify high-risk behavior and demographics
- Empower policyholders with clearer insights into their risk profiles
